  "details": "<p>Idyllic garden retreat just outside Weligama. DE WITTE RAAF \u2013 meaning White Raven in Dutch, is a colonial-style villa in a traditional Sri Lankan village, 10 minutes drive from the most spectacular beaches in the world. It sleeps 6-8 in simple open style accommodation with outdoor bathrooms. The villa is situated in almost half an acre of tropical garden in the village of Polwatte, 5 mins drive outside Weligama and 10 minutes drive from the surfing beaches of Mirissa. The villa was built during the time of the British and according to an article written about it in \"Montage\" magazine soon after it was renovated, it is one of the finest examples of its kind. It was skillfully restored by its current owner with the addition of a large garden pavillion living space, guest kitchen, staff quarters, a decorative lily pond and a plunge pool. Inside the main house, on either sides of the central double-height library, there are bedrooms with stairs up to a loft where additional sleeping areas were added. There are two ensuite bathrooms, both open to the sky, one of which is in a walled garden. The villa can comfortably accommodate eight guests and has been on rental through airbnb netting the owner more than USD$1,000 per month. The villa is very reluctantly for sale as owner has insufficient time to properly manage and supervise due to other commitments. The house currently has a live-in couple and is fully furnished and ready for leasing. Minor repairs and enhancements would definitely enhance income potential. </p>"
