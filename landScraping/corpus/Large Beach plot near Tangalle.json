  "details": "<p>Perfectly positioned facing a deep sandy beach, close to Hambantota, and with a wide lagoon to the rear, this property offers any investor or hotel developer a very practical site for development. The topography is such that the land consists of a long strip sandwiched between the beach, the road and the lagoon. The centre of the land is elevated by about 4/5 meters above sea and lagoon level which creates a floating sensation and results in panoramic views of both sides.<br>\n<br>\nRoad access is very good. There is power supply at the site. Located in a quiet location at least 4km away from the main road. Local wild life sanctuaries are just a short walk away. The new Airport at Hambantota is only 45 mins drive from this site and can be reached by internal flights from Colombo.</p>"
