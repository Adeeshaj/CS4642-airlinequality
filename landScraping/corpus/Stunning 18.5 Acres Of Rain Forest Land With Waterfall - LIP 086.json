  "details": "<p>LIP-086 This unique land with breathtaking natural beauty is surrounded by picturesque tea plantations and 50 acres of government protected rain forest.<br>\n<br>\nWith unspoiled mountain views and lush forest vegetation, this property offers waterfalls with rock pools, a crystal-clear river, elevations, huge black boulders, and a variety of trees and plants, including a banyan tree which is today known as one of the most sacred relics of the Buddhists in Sri Lanka.<br>\n<br>\nThe climate in Ella is tropical. It has significant rainfall most months, with a short dry season. This climate is considered to be like an English summer, warm and sunny during the day and slightly cooler at nights and early morning.<br>\n<br>\nElla has become a busy tourist area which is best known for its natural attractions such as Little Adam\u2019s Peak, Ella Rock, tea factories and plantations, and the Nine Arch Bridge.<br>\n<br>\nThis property would suit the development of an eco / yoga / Ayurvedic spa retreat or an exclusive villas development. The hotel industry is underdeveloped in the area, however there are a few properties nearby that have been developed, and this one could rival those with imagination, vision and inspiration.<br>\n<br>\nOnly 12 Km from the touristic Ella and 4km from the main city of Ballaketuwa, which has all amenities necessary, the property couldn\u2019t be better placed. This property is exceptionally well priced compared to other properties in the area. A must see property for nature lovers and those wanting to develop something unique and exclusive.</p>"
