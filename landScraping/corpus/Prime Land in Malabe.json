There used to be an old house on this property which we demolished and cleared up the land so it\u2019s ready to be used to build a modern house of your liking.<br>\n<br>\nThis is a golden opportunity to secure a great piece of land and it\u2019s a great investment too as the property prices are sky rocketing and they will always go up especially in Colombo suburbs like Malabe.<br>\n<br>\nAct now , don\u2019t delay. Contact my brother in law Merl who will be able to assist with your queries. <br>\n<br>\nHow to get there:<br>\nFrom Malabe Junction go towards Athurugiriya and when you get to Arangala junction turn in to Kahantota Road. Keep going for about a mile and you will see Malwatta Road on your left . The road after Malwatta Road (the paved road as shown in picture ) takes you to the property.<br>\n</p>"
