Selling for land value only.<br>\n<br>\nThe property has 2 sections: 1) The house with a large amount of land to the rear, heading to the hills. 2) The garage/driver's quarters with a large amount of land to the rear heading to the paddy fields. The main road goes in-between the garage and the house.<br>\n<br>\nThis is an ideal investment as land prices are expected to soar when the new Expressway is finished in 2019/2020. <br>\n</p>"
