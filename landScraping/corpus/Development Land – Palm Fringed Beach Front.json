  "details": "<p>Very attractively priced development site located between Tangalle and Hambantota. The area is a sparesly populated intermediate zone, where the weather is predominantly dry. The property is situated close to a nature reserve which attracts a wealth of migratory birds as well as the ever visible peacocks, and resident water birds. This beach attracts nesting turtles all year round. This is an ideal plot for someone looking to build a holiday home away from the main tourist destinations, yet it is located only 20 mins drive from the large town of Tangalle. There is a 4 star hotel located along the same beach.</p>"
