Only 2 acres will be sold out of this 5 acres land.<br>\nI am in need of money so I need to sell this Land immediately. So I am selling the land to a very affordable price which is 13 laks per acre being the total land price as 26 laks. <br>\n<br>\nThere are few teak trees grown and they will not be sold at this land rate (13 laks per acres). Cost of the trees can be negotiated or omitted. If omitted the trees will be cut before the land is sold. <br>\n<br>\nDeduru oya is bordered to a land adjacent to the Land for sale. ( 1km distance from river bank to the land for sale).<br>\nSeparate road is there to access the river. <br>\nFor those who are really expecting to be an owner of a mini estate like this which is used for cultivation, please contact me.<br>\nSome others who think these estates are like 10 perch lands in Colombo which are by the side of a Highway or few meters from super markets, please do not contact me.</p>"
