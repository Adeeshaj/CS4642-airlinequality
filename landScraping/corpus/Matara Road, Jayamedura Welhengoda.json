  "details": "<p>Located right at Kabalana beach, right in front of one of the best surf spots in the South called \"the Rock\". The beach is super popular during the whole year. In March 2018, the national surf contest has organized at this beach right in front of this land. There are many holiday resorts and guesthouses nearby so it has a very strategic location.The land is very strategic because it is one of the only remaining empty lands in the beach so everyone is using the land as an access point to the beach. So the circulation of tourists is very high which makes it perfect location for a restaurant&amp;bar, a souvenir shop or a surf shop.<br>\n</p>"
